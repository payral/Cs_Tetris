# Cs_Tetris
Coded Tetris to learn Unity and C# for the UCSB Annual Hackathon, SB Hacks.

## File Descriptions

Main code is in **SpawnTetromino.cs** and **TetrisBlock.cs**. The rest is Unity files.

Its tetris! The game you all know and love. The way this works is each square on the screen is a space in a grid. Each move is checked for validity, or else the Tetromino stops moving. Line deletion is also a feature!

This was practice for my team's submission to SB Hacks, BoxStax! Link to that repo [Here](https://github.com/juniortaeza/TheBoxStaxGame) and the Devpost link [Here](https://devpost.com/software/box-stacker)
